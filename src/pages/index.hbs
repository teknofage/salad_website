        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <h4>Residential ~ Commercial ~ Real Estate</h4>
        <p>


I’m a former government analyst and real estate administrative professional trained in Classical Feng Shui, as well as modern-day interior design.

I specialize in co-creating interior spaces with my clients that are visually beautiful but also FEEL good.

</br>

Ask yourself: “How do I *feel* in my home or office?

</br>

When you (or your family or clients) feel good in your home or office, this boosts the overall sense of happiness and well-being of all.

For families and individuals, this means your creativity has room to expand, and your life flows smoother because you simply feel better!

</br>

For businesses, watch productivity and foot traffic increase, and therefore revenue!</p>

            <p class="lead">“I have been interested in feng shui for many years, and Stephanie has always been there as a resource and a guide. Most recently, she helped me with a problem of too much water in my bedroom, and I was truly drowning in my relationship!! After following her suggestions to rebalance my elements there, I met my future husband just a few weeks later! Additionally, Stephanie introduced me to essential oils, which I found to be a very useful tool in managing my emotional and spiritual life. I am incredibly blessed to have had Stephanie’s help in my life!”
